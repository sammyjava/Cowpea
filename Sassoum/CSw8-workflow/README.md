# CSw8-workflow
Workflow diagram for the CSw8 gene-finding extravaganza

The "diagram" (a stack of figures with text) is in Open Document Graphics format, plus a PDF dump.

The supporting files are here as well, including the common bean genome paper, ng.3008.pdf, which contains the list of purported DRT seed-weight related genes.

The R routine plots the Venn diagram.
